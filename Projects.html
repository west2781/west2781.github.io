        <h2>Analytics Programming - Reddit Sentiment Analysis</h2>
        <p>In this project, I used Python to scrape and analyze Reddit posts related to football games, calculating sentiment scores to gauge fan reactions. Collaborating with a team, I compared sentiment across different games and applied data visualization techniques to present our findings in a clear and impactful way. This project showcases my ability to work with large datasets, perform sentiment analysis, and communicate insights effectively, skills that are valuable for data-driven decision-making in any organization.</p>

        <h2>Databases - Database Design for Company</h2>
        <p>In this project, I designed and engineered a relational database for a fictional fly-fishing company to manage customer orders, inventory, and sales data. Using SQL Server, I created, queried, and optimized the database to ensure data accuracy, integrity, and efficiency. This project demonstrates my solid foundation in database design, normalization, and entity-relationship modeling, and highlights my ability to build efficient and scalable data solutions.</p>
