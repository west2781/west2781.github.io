        <h2>Analytics Programming - Reddit Sentiment Analysis</h2>
        <p>In this project, I used Python to scrape and analyze Reddit posts related to football games, calculating sentiment scores to gauge fan reactions. Collaborating with a team, I compared sentiment across different games and applied data visualization techniques to present our findings in a clear and impactful way. This project showcases my ability to work with large datasets, perform sentiment analysis, and communicate insights effectively, skills that are valuable for data-driven decision-making in any organization.</p>

        <h2>Databases - Database Design for Company</h2>
        <p>In this project, I designed and engineered a relational database for a fictional fly-fishing company to manage customer orders, inventory, and sales data. Using SQL Server, I created, queried, and optimized the database to ensure data accuracy, integrity, and efficiency. This project demonstrates my solid foundation in database design, normalization, and entity-relationship modeling, and highlights my ability to build efficient and scalable data solutions.</p>

        <h2>Data Science - NBA Player Analysis</h2>
        <p>In this project, I utilized Python to clean and preprocess 2024 NBA player data, conducting regression and clustering analyses to evaluate player efficiency and forecast performance. This work highlights my skills in statistical modeling, pattern identification, and predictive analysis.</p>

        <h2>Data Warehousing - ETL Data Warehousing Project</h2>
        <p>I developed and executed ETL workflows using PostgreSQL and Spoon to process customer, item, and order data. Tasks included data cleaning, transforming columns with surrogate keys, and managing delta loads, ensuring data accuracy and integrity. This project underscores my expertise in ETL processes, data transformation, and data warehousing fundamentals.</p>
