       <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>Hi, I’m <strong>Lucas West</strong> — a data-driven problem solver with a passion for turning complex information into clear insights.</p>

        <p>I’m currently earning both my <strong>Bachelor’s in Management Information Systems</strong> and <strong>Master’s in Management Information and Technology</strong> at the University of Oklahoma. Throughout my academic journey, I’ve developed a strong foundation in <strong>data science, analytics, and engineering</strong>—skills I’ve put into practice through internships and hands-on projects that span industries like energy, healthcare, sports, and retail.</p>

        <p>Whether I’m building regression models with Python, designing databases in SQL Server, automating workflows in Alteryx, or creating interactive dashboards in Power BI and Tableau, I bring a focus on clarity, scalability, and impact. I thrive on making data useful — and usable.</p>

        <p>I’ve presented work to leadership boards, developed dashboards from multimillion-row datasets, and built applications that solve real-world business problems. My goal is to apply data skills in a way that drives strategy, efficiency, and innovation.</p>

        <p>Thanks for visiting my site — I hope you enjoy exploring my work!</p>
